ROCK PAPER SCISSORS IN PYTHON

I did a simple rock paper scissors game in python just to make my first repository here in github :)

Well, talking a bit about the code (ps: i'm brazillian so the variables in the code are actually in portuguese) :
Lines <br />
  1 - imported module random <br />
  3 - created a list called opcoes (options) with the itens pedra, papel and tesoura (rock, paper, scissors) <br />
  5 - created a variable called computador (computer) wich, by the function choice() from the module random, receives a aleatory item from the list opcoes <br />
  7 - created a variable called escolhaDoUsuario (user choice) wich will receive the user choice from the list <br />
9 - 24 - In these lines the variables computador and escolhaDoUsuario will pass for a series of comparisons to determine if the user input was valid and, if it was indeed valid, it will compare the user input with the value of the variable 'computador' so that the output comes as it should. These lines of comparison were all made remembering the idea that Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock and Scissors beats paper, and if the variables computador and escolhaDoUsuario have the same value the result is draw. <br />
